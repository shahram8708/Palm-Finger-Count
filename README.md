## fing.py

**Hand Gesture Detection**

This Python script is designed for hand gesture detection using the MediaPipe library. It detects various hand gestures in real-time video streams captured from a camera. The script utilizes the hand landmarks detected by MediaPipe to determine the status of each finger and counts the number of open fingers.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
3. Run the script by executing the command:
    ```
    python fing.py
    ```

## finger-name.py

**Hand Gesture Detection**

Similar to `fing.py`, this Python script also performs hand gesture detection using the MediaPipe library. It detects various hand gestures in real-time video streams and counts the number of open fingers. Additionally, this script includes the names of the fingers that are detected as open, providing more detailed information about the detected hand gestures.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
3. Run the script by executing the command:
    ```
    python finger-name.py
    ```

## finger.py

**Hand Gesture Detection**

This Python script is another implementation of hand gesture detection using the MediaPipe library. It detects hand gestures in real-time video streams and provides information about the status of each finger. Additionally, it calculates the position of the finger tips and determines whether each finger is open or closed based on its position relative to other landmarks on the hand.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
3. Run the script by executing the command:
    ```
    python finger.py
    ```

## human.py

**People Counting**

This Python script is designed for people counting using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method along with a Support Vector Machine (SVM). It detects human figures in real-time video streams captured from a camera and counts the number of people present in the frame. Additionally, it calculates the total count of people detected throughout the execution of the program.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
3. Run the script by executing the command:
    ```
    python human.py
    ```

## palm.py

**Hand Gesture Detection**

Similar to `fing.py` and `finger-name.py`, this Python script also performs hand gesture detection using the MediaPipe library. It detects various hand gestures in real-time video streams and counts the number of open fingers. Additionally, it may include additional features or variations in the hand gesture detection algorithm.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary packages by running:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
3. Run the script by executing the command:
    ```
    python palm.py
    ```
